    raise RuntimeError(msg)
RuntimeError: Cholesky errors typically occur when the same or very similar arms are suggested repeatedly. This can mean the model has already converged and you should avoid running further trials. It will also help to convert integer or categorical parameters to float ranges where reasonable.
Original error: : RuntimeError: 25 elements of the 25 element gradient array `gradf` are NaN. This often indicates numerical issues.
