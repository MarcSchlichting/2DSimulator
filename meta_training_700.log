If you meant to do this, you must specify 'dtype=object' when creating the ndarray.
  z_current = np.array([self.center.x,self.center.y,velocity_rframe[0],velocity_rframe[1]])
/home/mschl/2DSimulator/entities.py:153: FutureWarning: The input object of type 'Tensor' is an array-like implementing one of the corresponding protocols (`__array__`, `__array_interface__` or `__array_struct__`); but not a sequence (or 0-D). In the future, this object will be coerced as if it was first converted using `np.array(obj)`. To retain the old behaviour, you have to either modify the type 'Tensor', or assign to an empty array created with `np.empty(correct_shape, dtype=object)`.
  return np.array([z[2],z[3],acc[0],acc[1]])
